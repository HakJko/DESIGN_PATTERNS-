Composite pattern is a partitioning design pattern and describes a group of objects that is treated the same way as a 
    single instance of the same type of object. The intent of a composite is to “compose” objects into tree structures 
    to represent part-whole hierarchies. It allows you to have a tree structure and ask each node in the tree structure 
    to perform a task.
