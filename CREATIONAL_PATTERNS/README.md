_Design_ Patterns are common patterns that we use when writing our software. They represent established best practices 
    developed over time. These can then help us to ensure that our code is well designed and well built.

_Creational_ Patterns are design patterns that focus on how we obtain instances of objects. Typically, this means how we 
    construct new instances of a class, but in some cases, it means obtaining an already constructed instance ready for 
    us to use.
